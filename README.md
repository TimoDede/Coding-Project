# Coding-Project

In this project I want to write a script to extract data recorded from a time-resolved Pump-probe experiment, illustrate them as transient spectra (spectra at a fixed delay between pump and probe pulse) and transients (time traces at certain frequencies). If the time allows, I also want to implement a function for fitting the time traces to yield time constants for their decay.

The data are given in single files which are in a non-convenient format, which means that they have to be reorganized for better understanding.
The code should be able to average data and plot selected time delays, depending on the input of the user.
